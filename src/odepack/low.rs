/// *Description:
///     DLSODE solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
///     systems of first-order ODE's,
///
///        dy/dt = f(t,y) ,
///
///     or, in component form,
///
///        dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ))
///                                                  (i = 1, ..., NEQ) .
///
///     DLSODE is a package based on the GEAR and GEARB packages, and on
///     the October 23, 1978, version of the tentative ODEPACK user
///     interface standard, with minor modifications.
///
///     The steps in solving such a problem are as follows.
///
///     a. First write a subroutine of the form
///
///           SUBROUTINE  F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
///           INTEGER  NEQ
///           DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
///
///        which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with
///        f(i).
///
///     b. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
///        Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an
///        eigenvalue whose real part is negative and large in magnitude
///        compared to the reciprocal of the t span of interest.  If the
///        problem is nonstiff, use method flag MF = 10.  If it is stiff,
///        there are four standard choices for MF, and DLSODE requires the
///        Jacobian matrix in some form.  This matrix is regarded either
///        as full (MF = 21 or 22), or banded (MF = 24 or 25).  In the
///        banded case, DLSODE requires two half-bandwidth parameters ML
///        and MU. These are, respectively, the widths of the lower and
///        upper parts of the band, excluding the main diagonal.  Thus the
///        band consists of the locations (i,j) with
///
///           i - ML <= j <= i + MU ,
///
///        and the full bandwidth is ML + MU + 1 .
///
///     c. If the problem is stiff, you are encouraged to supply the
///        Jacobian directly (MF = 21 or 24), but if this is not feasible,
///        DLSODE will compute it internally by difference quotients (MF =
///        22 or 25).  If you are supplying the Jacobian, write a
///        subroutine of the form
///
///           SUBROUTINE  JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
///           INTEGER  NEQ, ML, MU, NRWOPD
///           DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
///
///        which provides df/dy by loading PD as follows:
///        - For a full Jacobian (MF = 21), load PD(i,j) with df(i)/dy(j),
///          the partial derivative of f(i) with respect to y(j).  (Ignore
///          the ML and MU arguments in this case.)
///        - For a banded Jacobian (MF = 24), load PD(i-j+MU+1,j) with
///          df(i)/dy(j); i.e., load the diagonal lines of df/dy into the
///          rows of PD from the top down.
///        - In either case, only nonzero elements need be loaded.
///
///     d. Write a main program that calls subroutine DLSODE once for each
///        point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
///        for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
///        by DLSODE.
///
///        Before the first call to DLSODE, set ISTATE = 1, set Y and T to
///        the initial values, and set TOUT to the first output point.  To
///        continue the integration after a successful return, simply
///        reset TOUT and call DLSODE again.  No other parameters need be
///        reset.
///
/// *Examples:
///     The following is a simple example problem, with the coding needed
///     for its solution by DLSODE. The problem is from chemical kinetics,
///     and consists of the following three rate equations:
///
///        dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.E4*y2*y3
///        dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.E4*y2*y3 - 3.E7*y2**2
///        dy3/dt = 3.E7*y2**2
///
///     on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.E10, with initial conditions
///     y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0. The problem is stiff.
///
///     The following coding solves this problem with DLSODE, using 
///     MF = 21 and printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.E10.  It uses 
///     ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than for y1 or y3 because y2 
///     has much smaller values.  At the end of the run, statistical 
///     quantities of interest are printed.

/// *Accuracy:

///
/// *Portability:
///     Since NEQ is dimensioned inside DLSODE, some compilers may object

///     use DIMENSION NEQ(1).  Similar remarks apply to RTOL and ATOL.

///
/// *Long Description:
///     The following complete description of the user interface to
///     DLSODE consists of four parts:
///
///     1.  The call sequence to subroutine DLSODE, which is a driver
///         routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
///         the call sequence arguments and user-supplied routines.
///         Following these descriptions is a description of optional
///         inputs available through the call sequence, and then a
///         description of optional outputs in the work arrays.
///
///     2.  Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODE package that may
///         be (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability
///         to alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
///         COMMON, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
///
///     3.  Descriptions of COMMON block to be declared in overlay or
///         similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
///         of the problem and continued solution later.
///
///     4.  Description of two routines in the DLSODE package, either of
///         which the user may replace with his own version, if desired.
///         These relate to the measurement of errors.
///
///
///                         Part 1.  Call Sequence
///                         ----------------------
///
///     Arguments
///     ---------
///     The call sequence parameters used for input only are
///
///        F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, MF,
///
///     and those used for both input and output are
///
///        Y, T, ISTATE.
///
///     The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
///     optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here
///     refers to the return from subroutine DLSODE to the user's calling
///     program.)
///
///     The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
///     initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
///     change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
///
///     The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
///
///     F        The name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the ODE
///              system.  The system must be put in the first-order form
///              dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function of
///              the scalar t and the vector y. Subroutine F is to compute
///              the function f. It is to have the form
///
///                 SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
///                 DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
///
///              where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT =
///              f(T,Y) is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
///              Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).  F must be
///              declared EXTERNAL in the calling program.
///
///              Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
///              NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),..., if NEQ is an array
///              (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
///              See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
///
///              If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
///              externally to DLSODE, an extra call to F should be made
///              for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
///              If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY
///              instead.
///
///     NEQ      The size of the ODE system (number of first-order
///              ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
///              NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the
///              problem.  If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input),
///              the remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed,
///              if these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
///
///              Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred
///              to as a scalar in this user interface description.
///              However, NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the
///              system size.  (The DLSODE package accesses only NEQ(1).)
///              In either case, this parameter is passed as the NEQ
///              argument in all calls to F and JAC.  Hence, if it is an
///              array, locations NEQ(2),... may be used to store other
///              integer data and pass it to F and/or JAC.  Subroutines
///              F and/or JAC must include NEQ in a DIMENSION statement
///              in that case.
///
///     Y        A real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
///              length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on
///              the first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on
///              other calls.  On the first call, Y must contain the
///              vector of initial values.  On output, Y contains the
///              computed solution vector, evaluated at T. If desired,
///              the Y array may be used for other purposes between
///              calls to the solver.
///
///              This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to F
///              and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
///              Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
///              pass it to F and/or JAC.  (The DLSODE package accesses
///              only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
///
///     T        The independent variable.  On input, T is used only on
///              the first call, as the initial point of the integration.
///              On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
///              computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as
///              TOUT).  On an error return, T is the farthest point
///              reached.
///
///     TOUT     The next value of T at which a computed solution is
///              desired.  Used only for input.
///
///              When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
///              to T for one call, then should not equal T for the next
///              call.  For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .NE. T
///              is used in order to determine the direction of the
///              integration (i.e., the algebraic sign of the step sizes)
///              and the rough scale of the problem.  Integration in
///              either direction (forward or backward in T) is permitted.
///
///              If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored
///              after the first call (i.e., the first call with
///              TOUT .NE. T).  Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
///
///              If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
///              monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
///              to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
///              TCUR - HU and TCUR.  (See "Optional Outputs" below for
///              TCUR and HU.)
///
///
///     ITOL     An indicator for the type of error control.  See
///              description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
///
///     RTOL     A relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
///              an array of length NEQ.  See description below under
///              ATOL.  Input only.
///
///     ATOL     An absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
///              an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
///
///              The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine the
///              error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
///              control the vector e = (e(i)) of estimated local errors
///              in Y, according to an inequality of the form
///
///                 rms-norm of ( e(i)/EWT(i) ) <= 1,
///
///              where
///
///                 EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
///
///              and the rms-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
///
///                 rms-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).
///
///              Here EWT = (EWT(i)) is a vector of weights which must
///              always be positive, and the values of RTOL and ATOL
///              should all be nonnegative.  The following table gives the
///              types (scalar/array) of RTOL and ATOL, and the
///              corresponding form of EWT(i).
///
///              ITOL    RTOL      ATOL      EWT(i)
///              ----    ------    ------    -----------------------------
///              1       scalar    scalar    RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
///              2       scalar    array     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
///              3       array     scalar    RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
///              4       array     array     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
///
///              When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
///              be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
///
///              If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
///              fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
///              error controls can be obtained by substituting
///              user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
///              the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
///
///              If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
///              run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
///              components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e., of EWT) should be
///              scaled down uniformly.
///
///     ITASK    An index specifying the task to be performed.  Input
///              only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings:
///              1   Normal computation of output values of y(t) at
///                  t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
///              2   Take one step only and return.
///              3   Stop at the first internal mesh point at or beyond
///                  t = TOUT and return.
///              4   Normal computation of output values of y(t) at
///                  t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.  TCRIT
///                  must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to or
///                  beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
///                  integration.  This option is useful if the problem
///                  has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
///              5   Take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
///                  TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
///
///              Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
///              (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
///              indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before
///              TCRIT, in which case answers at T = TOUT are returned
///              first).
///
///     ISTATE   An index used for input and output to specify the state
///              of the calculation.
///
///              On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows:
///              1   This is the first call for the problem
///                  (initializations will be done).  See "Note" below.
///              2   This is not the first call, and the calculation is to
///                  continue normally, with no change in any input
///                  parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.  (If ITOL,
///                  RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls with
///                  ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
///                  tested for legality.)
///              3   This is not the first call, and the calculation is to
///                  continue normally, but with a change in input
///                  parameters other than TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are
///                  allowed in NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
///                  ML, MU, and any of the optional inputs except H0.
///                  (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)
///
///              Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted as
///              a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
///              input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
///              purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)  Thus the
///              first call for which TOUT .NE. T requires ISTATE = 1 on
///              input.
///
///              On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings:
///               1  Nothing was done, as TOUT was equal to T with
///                  ISTATE = 1 on input.
///               2  The integration was performed successfully.
///              -1  An excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP steps)
///                  was done on this call, before completing the
///                  requested task, but the integration was otherwise
///                  successful as far as T. (MXSTEP is an optional input
///                  and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
///                  simply reset ISTATE to a value >1 and call again (the
///                  excess work step counter will be reset to 0).  In
///                  addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid this
///                  error return; see "Optional Inputs" below.
///              -2  Too much accuracy was requested for the precision of
///                  the machine being used.  This was detected before
///                  completing the requested task, but the integration
///                  was successful as far as T. To continue, the
///                  tolerance parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must
///                  be set to 3. The optional output TOLSF may be used
///                  for this purpose.  (Note:  If this condition is
///                  detected before taking any steps, then an illegal
///                  input return (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
///              -3  Illegal input was detected, before taking any
///                  integration steps.  See written message for details.
///                  (Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of
///                  calls to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
///                  the run to stop.)
///              -4  There were repeated error-test failures on one
///                  attempted step, before completing the requested task,

///                  inappropriate.
///              -5  There were repeated convergence-test failures on one
///                  attempted step, before completing the requested task,
///                  but the integration was successful as far as T. This
///                  may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix, if
///                  one is being used.
///              -6  EWT(i) became zero for some i during the integration.
///                  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0) was

///                  integration was successful as far as T.
///
///              Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2, it
///              does not need to be reset for normal continuation.  Also,
///              since a negative input value of ISTATE will be regarded
///              as illegal, a negative output value requires the user to

///     Detailed instructions for using DINTDY
///     --------------------------------------
///     The form of the CALL is:
///
///           CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
///
///     The input parameters are:
///
///     T          Value of independent variable where answers are
///                desired (normally the same as the T last returned by
///                DLSODE).  For valid results, T must lie between
///                TCUR - HU and TCUR.  (See "Optional Outputs" above
///                for TCUR and HU.)
///     K          Integer order of the derivative desired.  K must
///                satisfy 0 <= K <= NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current
///                order (see "Optional Outputs").  The capability
///                corresponding to K = 0, i.e., computing y(t), is
///                already provided by DLSODE directly.  Since
///                NQCUR >= 1, the first derivative dy/dt is always
///                available with DINTDY.
///     RWORK(21)  The base address of the history array YH.
///     NYH        Column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
///
///     The output parameters are:
///
///     DKY        Real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
///                of the Kth derivative of y(t).
///     IFLAG      Integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
///                -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
///                On an error return, a message is also written.

///                          Part 3.  Common Blocks
///                          ----------------------
///
///     If DLSODE is to be used in an overlay situation, the user must
///     declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
///     (1) the call sequence to DLSODE,
///     (2) the internal COMMON block /DLS001/, of length 255 
///         (218 double precision words followed by 37 integer words).
///
///     If DLSODE is used on a system in which the contents of internal
///     COMMON blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
///     declare the above COMMON block in his main program to insure that
///     its contents are preserved.
///
///     If the solution of a given problem by DLSODE is to be interrupted
///     and then later continued, as when restarting an interrupted run or
///     alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
///     following the return from the last DLSODE call prior to the
///     interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
///     internal COMMON block, and later restore these values before the
///     next DLSODE call for that problem.   In addition, if XSETUN and/or
///     XSETF was called for non-default handling of error messages, then
///     these calls must be repeated.  To save and restore the COMMON
///     block, use subroutine DSRCOM (see Part 2 above).
///
///
///              Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines
///              -----------------------------------------------
///
///     Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODE package which
///     relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
///     replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since
///     such a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it
///     should be done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great
///     caution.  (Note:  The means by which the package version of a
///     routine is superseded by the user's version may be system-
///     dependent.)
///
///     DEWSET
///     ------
///     The following subroutine is called just before each internal
///     integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
///     described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
///
///           SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
///
///     where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODE call
///     sequence, YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector,
///     and EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
///
///     If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
///     (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
///     in Y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the
///     DVNORM routine (see below), and also used by DLSODE in the
///     computation of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian
///     approximation, and the increments for difference quotient
///     Jacobians.
///
///     In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
///     the current values of derivatives of y. Derivatives up to order NQ
///     are available from the history array YH, described above under
///     optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
///     extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
///     factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
///     given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
///     NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
///     can be obtained by including in SEWSET the statements:
///           DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
///           COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
///           NQ = ILS(33)
///           NST = ILS(34)
///           H = RLS(212)
///     Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
///     YCUR(NYH+i)/H (i=1,...,NEQ) (and the division by H is unnecessary
///     when NST = 0).
///
///     DVNORM
///     ------
///     DVNORM is a real function routine which computes the weighted
///     root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
///
///        d = DVNORM (n, v, w)
///
///     where:
///     n = the length of the vector,
///     v = real array of length n containing the vector,
///     w = real array of length n containing weights,
///     d = SQRT( (1/n) * sum(v(i)*w(i))**2 ).
///
///     DVNORM is called with n = NEQ and with w(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
///     EWT is as set by subroutine DEWSET.
///
///     If the user supplies this function, it should return a nonnegative
///     value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODE.
///     None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.  For example, a
///     user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
///     - Substitute a max-norm of (v(i)*w(i)) for the rms-norm, or
///     - Ignore some components of v in the norm, with the effect of
///       suppressing the error control on those components of Y.

/// Summary of Usage.
///
/// Communication between the user and the DLSODES package, for normal
/// situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
/// of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
/// details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
/// and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
/// problem (with program and output) following this summary.
///
/// A. First provide a subroutine of the form:
///               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
///               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
/// which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
///
/// B. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
/// Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an eigenvalue
/// whose real part is negative and large in magnitude, compared to the
/// reciprocal of the t span of interest.  If the problem is nonstiff,
/// use a method flag MF = 10.  If it is stiff, there are two standard
/// choices for the method flag, MF = 121 and MF = 222.  In both cases,
/// DLSODES requires the Jacobian matrix in some form, and it treats this
/// matrix in general sparse form, with sparsity structure determined
/// internally.  (For options where the user supplies the sparsity
/// structure, see the full description of MF below.)
///
/// C. If the problem is stiff, you are encouraged to supply the Jacobian
/// directly (MF = 121), but if this is not feasible, DLSODES will
/// compute it internally by difference quotients (MF = 222).
/// If you are supplying the Jacobian, provide a subroutine of the form:
///               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, PDJ)
///               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), IAN(*), JAN(*), PDJ(*)
/// Here NEQ, T, Y, and J are input arguments, and the JAC routine is to
/// load the array PDJ (of length NEQ) with the J-th column of df/dy.
/// I.e., load PDJ(i) with df(i)/dy(J) for all relevant values of i.
/// The arguments IAN and JAN should be ignored for normal situations.
/// DLSODES will call the JAC routine with J = 1,2,...,NEQ.
/// Only nonzero elements need be loaded.  Usually, a crude approximation
/// to df/dy, possibly with fewer nonzero elements, will suffice.
///
/// D. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODES once for
/// each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
/// for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
/// DLSODES.  On the first call to DLSODES, supply arguments as follows:
/// F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
///          This name must be declared External in calling program.
/// NEQ    = number of first order ODEs.
/// Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
/// T      = the initial value of the independent variable t.
/// TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
/// ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
/// RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
/// ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
///          The estimated local error in Y(i) will be controlled so as
///          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
///             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
///             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
///          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
///          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
///          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
///          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
///          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
///          control.  Caution: actual (global) errors may exceed these
///          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
/// ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of Y at t = TOUT.
/// ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
/// IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
/// RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
///             20 + 16*NEQ            for MF = 10,
///             20 + (2 + 1./LENRAT)*NNZ + (11 + 9./LENRAT)*NEQ
///                                    for MF = 121 or 222,
///          where:
///          NNZ    = the number of nonzero elements in the sparse
///                   Jacobian (if this is unknown, use an estimate), and
///          LENRAT = the real to integer wordlength ratio (usually 1 in
///                   single precision and 2 in double precision).
///          In any case, the required size of RWORK cannot generally
///          be predicted in advance if MF = 121 or 222, and the value
///          above is a rough estimate of a crude lower bound.  Some
///          experimentation with this size may be necessary.
///          (When known, the correct required length is an optional
///          output, available in IWORK(17).)
/// LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user dimension).
/// IWORK  = integer work array of length at least 30.
/// LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user dimension).
/// JAC    = name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix (MF = 121).
///          If used, this name must be declared External in calling
///          program.  If not used, pass a dummy name.
/// MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
///          10  for nonstiff (Adams) method, no Jacobian used
///          121 for stiff (BDF) method, user-supplied sparse Jacobian
///          222 for stiff method, internally generated sparse Jacobian
/// Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
/// and possibly ATOL.
///
/// E. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
///      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
///      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
/// ISTATE = 2  if DLSODES was successful, negative otherwise.
///          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong MF).
///          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
///          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
///          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
///          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
///             supplied or wrong choice of MF or tolerances).
///          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
///             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
///          -7 means a fatal error return flag came from sparse solver
///             CDRV by way of DPRJS or DSOLSS.  Should never happen.
///          A return with ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5 may result from using
///          an inappropriate sparsity structure, one that is quite
///          different from the initial structure.  Consider calling
///          DLSODES again with ISTATE = 3 to force the structure to be
///          reevaluated.  See the full description of ISTATE below.
///
/// F. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
/// reset TOUT and call DLSODES again.  No other parameters need be reset.
///
///-----------------------------------------------------------------------
/// Example Problem.

/// Full Description of User Interface to DLSODES.
///
/// The user interface to DLSODES consists of the following parts.
///
/// 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODES, which is a driver
///      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
///      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
///      Following these descriptions is a description of
///      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
///      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
///
/// 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODES package that may be
///      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
///      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
///      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
///
/// 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
///      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
///      of the problem and continued solution later.
///
/// 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODES package, either of
///      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
///      These relate to the measurement of errors.
///
///-----------------------------------------------------------------------
/// Part 1.  Call Sequence.
///
/// The call sequence parameters used for input only are
///     F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, MF,
/// and those used for both input and output are
///     Y, T, ISTATE.
/// The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
/// optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
/// to the return from Subroutine DLSODES to the user's calling program.)
///
/// The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
/// initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
/// change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
///
/// The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
///
/// F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
///          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
///          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
///          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
///          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
///               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
///               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
///          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
///          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
///          Subroutine F should not alter y(1),...,y(NEQ).
///          F must be declared External in the calling program.
///
///          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
///          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
///          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
///          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
///
///          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
///          externally to DLSODES, an extra call to F should be made
///          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
///          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
///
/// NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order
///          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
///          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
///          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
///          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
///          these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
///
///          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
///          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
///          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
///          (The DLSODES package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
///          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
///          to F and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array, locations
///          NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
///          it to F and/or JAC.  Subroutines F and/or JAC must include
///          NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
///
/// Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
///          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
///          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
///          on the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
///          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
///          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
///          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
///
///          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to
///          F and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
///          Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
///          pass it to F and/or JAC.  (The DLSODES package accesses only
///          Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
///
/// T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
///          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
///          on output, after each call, T is the value at which a
///          computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
///          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
///
/// TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
///          Used only for input.
///
///          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
///          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
///          For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
///          in order to determine the direction of the integration
///          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
///          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
///          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
///
///          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
///          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
///          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
///
///          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
///          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
///          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
///          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
///          TCUR and HU).
///
/// ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
///          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
///
/// RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
///          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
///          Input only.
///
/// ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
///          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
///
///             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
///          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
///          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
///          in y, according to an inequality of the form
///                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
///          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
///          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
///          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
///          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
///          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
///          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
///          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
///
///             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
///              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL

///
///          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
///          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
///
///          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
///          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
///          error controls can be obtained by substituting
///          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
///          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.
///
///          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
///          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
///          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
///          down uniformly.
///
/// ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
///          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
///          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
///             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
///          2  means take one step only and return.
///          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
///             beyond t = TOUT and return.
///          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
///             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
///             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to

///             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
///          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.

///
///          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT

///              The problem may have a singularity, or the input

///              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix,

///
///          Note: an error return with ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5 and with

///
///          Note:  since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
///          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
///          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be

///                             a successful return from DLSODES.
///
/// The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.

///
///   LYH = IWORK(22)
///   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(LYH), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
///
/// The input parameters are:
///
/// T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
///             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODES).
///             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
///             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
/// K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
///             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
///             (See optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
///             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
///             by DLSODES directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first

/// LYH       = the base address of the history array YH, obtained
///             as an optional output as shown above.
/// NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
///
/// The output parameters are:
///
/// DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
///             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
/// IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
///             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
///             On an error return, a message is also written.
///-----------------------------------------------------------------------
/// Part 3.  Common Blocks.
///
/// If DLSODES is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
/// must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
///   (1) the call sequence to DLSODES, and
///   (2) the two internal Common blocks
///         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
///                      followed by 37 integer words),
///         /DLSS01/  of length  40  (6 double precision words
///                      followed by 34 integer words),
///
/// If DLSODES is used on a system in which the contents of internal
/// Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
/// declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
/// that their contents are preserved.
///
/// If the solution of a given problem by DLSODES is to be interrupted
/// and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
/// or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
/// following the return from the last DLSODES call prior to the
/// interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
/// internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
/// next DLSODES call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
/// blocks, use Subroutine DSRCMS (see Part 2 above).
///
///-----------------------------------------------------------------------
/// Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
///
/// Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODES package which
/// relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
/// replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
/// a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
/// done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
/// (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
/// superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
///
/// (a) DEWSET.
/// The following subroutine is called just before each internal
/// integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
/// described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
///     Subroutine DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
/// where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODES call sequence,
/// YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
/// EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
///
/// If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
/// (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
/// in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
/// routine (see below), and also used by DLSODES in the computation
/// of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
/// and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
///
/// In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
/// the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
/// are available from the history array YH, described above under
/// optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
/// extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
/// factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
/// given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
/// NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
/// can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
///     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
///     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
///     NQ = ILS(33)
///     NST = ILS(34)
///     H = RLS(212)
/// Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
/// YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
/// unnecessary when NST = 0).
///
/// (b) DVNORM.
/// The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
/// root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
///     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
/// where
///   N = the length of the vector,
///   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
///   W = real array of length N containing weights,
///   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
/// DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
/// EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
///
/// If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
/// value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODES.
/// None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
/// For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
///   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
///   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
///    suppressing the error control on those components of y.
