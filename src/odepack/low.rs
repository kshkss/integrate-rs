//!  ODEPACK is a collection of Fortran solvers for the initial value
//! problem for ordinary differential equation systems.  It consists of nine
//! solvers, namely a basic solver called LSODE and eight variants of it --
//! LSODES, LSODA, LSODAR, LSODPK, LSODKR, LSODI, LSOIBT, and LSODIS.
//! The collection is suitable for both stiff and nonstiff systems.  It
//! includes solvers for systems given in explicit form, dy/dt = f(t,y),
//! and also solvers for systems given in linearly implicit form,
//! A(t,y) dy/dt = g(t,y).  Two of the solvers use general sparse matrix
//! solvers for the linear systems that arise.  Two others use iterative
//! (preconditioned Krylov) methods instead of direct methods for these
//! linear systems.  The most recent addition is LSODIS, which solves
//! implicit problems with general sparse treatment of all matrices involved.
//!
//!    The ODEPACK solvers are written in standard Fortran 77, with a few
//! exceptions, and with minimal machine dependencies.  There are separate
//! double and single precision versions of ODEPACK.  The actual solver
//! names are those given above with a prefix of D- or S- for the double
//! or single precision version, respectively, i.e. DLSODE/SLSODE, etc.
//! Each solver consists of a main driver subroutine having the same name
//! as the solver and some number of subordinate routines.  For each
//! solver, there is also a demonstration program, which solves one or two
//! simple problems in a somewhat self-checking manner.
//!
//!    Recently, the ODEPACK solvers were upgraded to improve their
//! portability in numerous ways.  Among the improvements are (a) renaming
//! of routines and Common blocks to distinguish double and single
//! precision versions, (b) use of generic intrinsic function names, (c)
//! elimination of the Block Data subprogram, (d) use of a portable
//! routine to set the unit roundoff, and (e) passing of quoted strings to
//! the error message handler.  In addition, the prologue and internal
//! comments were reformatted, and use mixed upper/lower case.  Numerous
//! minor corrections and improvements were also made.  
//!
//!    The above upgrade operations were applied to LSODE earlier than they
//! were to the rest of ODEPACK, and the two upgrades were done somewhat
//! independently.  As a result, some differences will be apparent in the
//! source files of LSODE and the other solvers -- primarily in the
//! formatting of the comment line prologue of the main driver routine.
//! In Subroutines DLSODE/SLSODE and their subordinate routines, the
//! prologue was written in "SLATEC format", while for the other solvers a
//! more relaxed style was used.  The differences are entirely cosmetic,
//! however, and do not affect performance.
//!
//!    Documentation on the usage of each solver is provided in the
//! initial block of comment lines in the source file, which (in most
//! cases) includes a simple example.  A demonstration program (in
//! seperate double/single precision versions) is also available.
//!
//!    What follows is a summary of the capabilities of ODEPACK, comments
//! about usage documentation, and notes about installing the collection.
//! For additional documentation on ODEPACK, see also the papers [1], [2]
//! (for LSODE), and [3] (for LSODPK and LSODKR), and in the references
//! cited there.  (However, the document [2] does not reflect the upgrade
//! operations described above.)

//!
//!                      I. Summary of the ODEPACK Solvers
//!
//! A. Solvers for explicitly given systems.
//!
//! For each of the following solvers, it is assumed that the ODEs are
//! given explicitly, so that the system can be written in the form
//! dy/dt = f(t,y), where y is the vector of dependent variables, and t is
//! the independent variable.
//!
//! 1. LSODE (Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations) is the
//!    basic solver of the collection.  It solves stiff and nonstiff systems
//!    of the form dy/dt = f.  In the stiff case, it treats the Jacobian
//!    matrix df/dy as either a dense (full) or a banded matrix, and as either
//!    user-supplied or internally approximated by difference quotients.  
//!    It uses Adams methods (predictor-corrector) in the nonstiff case,
//!    and Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) methods (the Gear methods)
//!    in the stiff case.  The linear systems that arise are solved by direct
//!    methods (LU factor/solve).  LSODE supersedes the older GEAR and GEARB
//!    packages, and reflects a complete redesign of the user interface
//!    and internal organization, with some algorithmic improvements.
//!
//! 2. LSODES, written jointly with A. H. Sherman, solves systems dy/dt = f
//!    and in the stiff case treats the Jacobian matrix in general sparse
//!    form.  It determines the sparsity structure on its own, or optionally
//!    accepts this information from the user.  It then uses parts of the
//!    Yale Sparse Matrix Package (YSMP) to solve the linear systems that
//!    arise, by a sparse (direct) LU factorization/backsolve method.
//!    LSODES supersedes, and improves upon, the older GEARS package.
//!
//! 3. LSODA, written jointly with L. R. Petzold, solves systems dy/dt = f
//!    with a dense or banded Jacobian when the problem is stiff, but it
//!    automatically selects between nonstiff (Adams) and stiff (BDF)
//!    methods.  It uses the nonstiff method initially, and dynamically
//!    monitors data in order to decide which method to use.
//!
//! 4. LSODAR, also written jointly with L. R. Petzold, is a variant of
//!    LSODA with a rootfinding capability added.  Thus it solves problems
//!    dy/dt = f with dense or banded Jacobian and automatic method
//!    selection, and at the same time, it finds the roots of any of a
//!    set of given functions of the form g(t,y).  This is often useful
//!    for finding stop conditions, or for finding points at which a switch
//!    is to be made in the function f.
//!
//! 5. LSODPK, written jointly with Peter N. Brown, is a variant of LSODE
//!    in which the direct solvers for the linear systems have been replaced
//!    by a selection of four preconditioned Krylov (iterative) solvers.  
//!    The user must supply a pair of routine to evaluate, preprocess, and
//!    solve the (left and/or right) preconditioner matrices.  LSODPK also
//!    includes an option for a user-supplied linear system solver to be used
//!    without Krylov iteration.
//!
//! 6. LSODKR is a variant of LSODPK with the addition of the same
//!    rootfinding capability as in LSODAR, and also of automatic switching
//!    between functional and Newton iteration.  The nonlinear iteration
//!    method-switching differs from the method-switching in LSODA and LSODAR,
//!    but provides similar savings by using the cheaper method in the non-stiff
//!    regions of the problem.  LSODKR also improves on the Krylov methods in
//!    LSODPK by offering the option to save and reuse the approximate Jacobian
//!    data underlying the preconditioner.
//!
//!
//! B. Solvers for linearly implicit systems.
//!
//! The following solvers treat systems in the linearly implicit form
//! A(t,y) dy/dt = g(t,y), A = a square matrix, i.e. with the derivative
//! dy/dt implicit, but linearly so.  These solvers allow A to be
//! singular, in which case the system is a differential-algebraic
//! equation (DAE) system.  In that case, the user must be very careful
//! to supply a well-posed problem with consistent initial conditions.
//!
//! 7. LSODI, written jointly with J. F. Painter, solves linearly implicit
//!    systems in which the matrices involved (A, dg/dy, and d(A dy/dt)/dy)
//!    are all assumed to be either dense or banded.  LSODI supersedes the
//!    older GEARIB solver and improves upon it in numerous ways.
//!
//! 8. LSOIBT, written jointly with C. S. Kenney, solves linearly implicit
//!    systems in which the matrices involved are all assumed to be
//!    block-tridiagonal.  Linear systems are solved by the LU method.
//!
//! 9. LSODIS, written jointly with S. Balsdon, solves linearly implicit
//!    systems in which the matrices involved are all assumed to be sparse.
//!    Like LSODES, LSODIS either determines the sparsity structure or
//!    accepts it from the user, and uses parts of the Yale Sparse Matrix
//!    Package to solve the linear systems that arise, by a direct method.

    /// *Description:
    ///     DLSODE solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
    ///     systems of first-order ODE's,
    ///
    ///        dy/dt = f(t,y) ,
    ///
    ///     or, in component form,
    ///
    ///        dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ))
    ///                                                  (i = 1, ..., NEQ) .
    ///
    ///     DLSODE is a package based on the GEAR and GEARB packages, and on
    ///     the October 23, 1978, version of the tentative ODEPACK user
    ///     interface standard, with minor modifications.
    ///
    ///     The steps in solving such a problem are as follows.
    ///
    ///     a. First write a subroutine of the form
    ///
    ///           SUBROUTINE  F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
    ///           INTEGER  NEQ
    ///           DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
    ///
    ///        which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with
    ///        f(i).
    ///
    ///     b. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
    ///        Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an
    ///        eigenvalue whose real part is negative and large in magnitude
    ///        compared to the reciprocal of the t span of interest.  If the
    ///        problem is nonstiff, use method flag MF = 10.  If it is stiff,
    ///        there are four standard choices for MF, and DLSODE requires the
    ///        Jacobian matrix in some form.  This matrix is regarded either
    ///        as full (MF = 21 or 22), or banded (MF = 24 or 25).  In the
    ///        banded case, DLSODE requires two half-bandwidth parameters ML
    ///        and MU. These are, respectively, the widths of the lower and
    ///        upper parts of the band, excluding the main diagonal.  Thus the
    ///        band consists of the locations (i,j) with
    ///
    ///           i - ML <= j <= i + MU ,
    ///
    ///        and the full bandwidth is ML + MU + 1 .
    ///
    ///     c. If the problem is stiff, you are encouraged to supply the
    ///        Jacobian directly (MF = 21 or 24), but if this is not feasible,
    ///        DLSODE will compute it internally by difference quotients (MF =
    ///        22 or 25).  If you are supplying the Jacobian, write a
    ///        subroutine of the form
    ///
    ///           SUBROUTINE  JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
    ///           INTEGER  NEQ, ML, MU, NRWOPD
    ///           DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
    ///
    ///        which provides df/dy by loading PD as follows:
    ///        - For a full Jacobian (MF = 21), load PD(i,j) with df(i)/dy(j),
    ///          the partial derivative of f(i) with respect to y(j).  (Ignore
    ///          the ML and MU arguments in this case.)
    ///        - For a banded Jacobian (MF = 24), load PD(i-j+MU+1,j) with
    ///          df(i)/dy(j); i.e., load the diagonal lines of df/dy into the
    ///          rows of PD from the top down.
    ///        - In either case, only nonzero elements need be loaded.
    ///
    ///     d. Write a main program that calls subroutine DLSODE once for each
    ///        point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
    ///        for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
    ///        by DLSODE.
    ///
    ///        Before the first call to DLSODE, set ISTATE = 1, set Y and T to
    ///        the initial values, and set TOUT to the first output point.  To
    ///        continue the integration after a successful return, simply
    ///        reset TOUT and call DLSODE again.  No other parameters need be
    ///        reset.
    ///
    /// *Examples:
    ///     The following is a simple example problem, with the coding needed
    ///     for its solution by DLSODE. The problem is from chemical kinetics,
    ///     and consists of the following three rate equations:
    ///
    ///        dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.E4*y2*y3
    ///        dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.E4*y2*y3 - 3.E7*y2**2
    ///        dy3/dt = 3.E7*y2**2
    ///
    ///     on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.E10, with initial conditions
    ///     y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0. The problem is stiff.
    ///
    ///     The following coding solves this problem with DLSODE, using
    ///     MF = 21 and printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.E10.  It uses
    ///     ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than for y1 or y3 because y2
    ///     has much smaller values.  At the end of the run, statistical
    ///     quantities of interest are printed.

    /// *Long Description:
    ///     The following complete description of the user interface to
    ///     DLSODE consists of four parts:
    ///
    ///     1.  The call sequence to subroutine DLSODE, which is a driver
    ///         routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
    ///         the call sequence arguments and user-supplied routines.
    ///         Following these descriptions is a description of optional
    ///         inputs available through the call sequence, and then a
    ///         description of optional outputs in the work arrays.
    ///
    ///     2.  Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODE package that may
    ///         be (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability
    ///         to alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
    ///         COMMON, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
    ///
    ///     3.  Descriptions of COMMON block to be declared in overlay or
    ///         similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
    ///         of the problem and continued solution later.
    ///
    ///     4.  Description of two routines in the DLSODE package, either of
    ///         which the user may replace with his own version, if desired.
    ///         These relate to the measurement of errors.
    ///
    ///
    ///                         Part 1.  Call Sequence
    ///                         ----------------------
    ///
    ///     Arguments
    ///     ---------
    ///     The call sequence parameters used for input only are

    ///        F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, MF,
    ///
    ///     and those used for both input and output are
    ///
    ///        Y, T, ISTATE.
    ///
    ///     The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
    ///     optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here
    ///     refers to the return from subroutine DLSODE to the user's calling
    ///     program.)
    ///
    ///     The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
    ///     initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
    ///     change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
    ///
    ///     The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
    ///
    ///     F        The name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the ODE
    ///              system.  The system must be put in the first-order form
    ///              dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function of
    ///              the scalar t and the vector y. Subroutine F is to compute
    ///              the function f. It is to have the form

    ///              Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).  F must be

    ///              See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
    ///
    ///              If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
    ///              externally to DLSODE, an extra call to F should be made
    ///              for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
    ///              If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY

    ///              ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
    ///              NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the
    ///              problem.  If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input),
    ///              the remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed,
    ///              if these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
    ///
    ///              Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred
    ///              to as a scalar in this user interface description.
    ///              However, NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the

    ///
    ///     Y        A real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
    ///              length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on
    ///              the first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on
    ///              other calls.  On the first call, Y must contain the
    ///              vector of initial values.  On output, Y contains the
    ///              computed solution vector, evaluated at T. If desired,
    ///              the Y array may be used for other purposes between

    /// Summary of Usage.
    ///
    /// Communication between the user and the DLSODES package, for normal
    /// situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
    /// of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
    /// details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
    /// and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
    /// problem (with program and output) following this summary.
    ///
    /// A. First provide a subroutine of the form:
    ///               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
    ///               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
    /// which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
    ///
    /// B. Next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
    /// Stiffness occurs when the Jacobian matrix df/dy has an eigenvalue
    /// whose real part is negative and large in magnitude, compared to the
    /// reciprocal of the t span of interest.  If the problem is nonstiff,
    /// use a method flag MF = 10.  If it is stiff, there are two standard
    /// choices for the method flag, MF = 121 and MF = 222.  In both cases,
    /// DLSODES requires the Jacobian matrix in some form, and it treats this
    /// matrix in general sparse form, with sparsity structure determined
    /// internally.  (For options where the user supplies the sparsity
    /// structure, see the full description of MF below.)
    ///
    /// C. If the problem is stiff, you are encouraged to supply the Jacobian
    /// directly (MF = 121), but if this is not feasible, DLSODES will
    /// compute it internally by difference quotients (MF = 222).
    /// If you are supplying the Jacobian, provide a subroutine of the form:
    ///               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, PDJ)
    ///               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), IAN(*), JAN(*), PDJ(*)
    /// Here NEQ, T, Y, and J are input arguments, and the JAC routine is to
    /// load the array PDJ (of length NEQ) with the J-th column of df/dy.
    /// I.e., load PDJ(i) with df(i)/dy(J) for all relevant values of i.
    /// The arguments IAN and JAN should be ignored for normal situations.
    /// DLSODES will call the JAC routine with J = 1,2,...,NEQ.
    /// Only nonzero elements need be loaded.  Usually, a crude approximation
    /// to df/dy, possibly with fewer nonzero elements, will suffice.
    ///
    /// D. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODES once for
    /// each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
    /// for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
    /// DLSODES.  On the first call to DLSODES, supply arguments as follows:
    /// F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
    ///          This name must be declared External in calling program.
    /// NEQ    = number of first order ODEs.
    /// Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
    /// T      = the initial value of the independent variable t.
    /// TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
    /// ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
    /// RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
    /// ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
    ///          The estimated local error in Y(i) will be controlled so as
    ///          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
    ///             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
    ///             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
    ///          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
    ///          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
    ///          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
    ///          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
    ///          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
    ///          control.  Caution: actual (global) errors may exceed these
    ///          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
    /// ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of Y at t = TOUT.
    /// ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
    /// IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
    /// RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
    ///             20 + 16*NEQ            for MF = 10,
    ///             20 + (2 + 1./LENRAT)*NNZ + (11 + 9./LENRAT)*NEQ
    ///                                    for MF = 121 or 222,
    ///          where:
    ///          NNZ    = the number of nonzero elements in the sparse
    ///                   Jacobian (if this is unknown, use an estimate), and
    ///          LENRAT = the real to integer wordlength ratio (usually 1 in
    ///                   single precision and 2 in double precision).
    ///          In any case, the required size of RWORK cannot generally
    ///          be predicted in advance if MF = 121 or 222, and the value
    ///          above is a rough estimate of a crude lower bound.  Some
    ///          experimentation with this size may be necessary.
    ///          (When known, the correct required length is an optional
    ///          output, available in IWORK(17).)
    /// LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user dimension).
    /// IWORK  = integer work array of length at least 30.
    /// LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user dimension).
    /// JAC    = name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix (MF = 121).
    ///          If used, this name must be declared External in calling
    ///          program.  If not used, pass a dummy name.
    /// MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
    ///          10  for nonstiff (Adams) method, no Jacobian used
    ///          121 for stiff (BDF) method, user-supplied sparse Jacobian
    ///          222 for stiff method, internally generated sparse Jacobian
    /// Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
    /// and possibly ATOL.
    ///
    /// E. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
    ///      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
    ///      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
    /// ISTATE = 2  if DLSODES was successful, negative otherwise.
    ///          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong MF).
    ///          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
    ///          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
    ///          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
    ///          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
    ///             supplied or wrong choice of MF or tolerances).
    ///          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
    ///             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
    ///          -7 means a fatal error return flag came from sparse solver
    ///             CDRV by way of DPRJS or DSOLSS.  Should never happen.
    ///          A return with ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5 may result from using
    ///          an inappropriate sparsity structure, one that is quite
    ///          different from the initial structure.  Consider calling
    ///          DLSODES again with ISTATE = 3 to force the structure to be
    ///          reevaluated.  See the full description of ISTATE below.
    ///
    /// F. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
    /// reset TOUT and call DLSODES again.  No other parameters need be reset.

    /// Full Description of User Interface to DLSODES.
    ///
    /// The user interface to DLSODES consists of the following parts.
    ///
    /// 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODES, which is a driver
    ///      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
    ///      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
    ///      Following these descriptions is a description of
    ///      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
    ///      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
    ///
    /// 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODES package that may be
    ///      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
    ///      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
    ///      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
    ///
    /// 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
    ///      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
    ///      of the problem and continued solution later.
    ///
    /// 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODES package, either of
    ///      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
    ///      These relate to the measurement of errors.
    ///
    ///-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    /// Part 1.  Call Sequence.
    ///
    /// The call sequence parameters used for input only are
    ///     F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, MF,
    /// and those used for both input and output are
    ///     Y, T, ISTATE.
    /// The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
    /// optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
    /// to the return from Subroutine DLSODES to the user's calling program.)
    ///
    /// The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
    /// initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
    /// change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
    ///
    /// The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
    ///
    /// F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
    ///          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
    ///          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
    ///          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
    ///          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
    ///               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
    ///               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
    ///          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
    ///          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
    ///          Subroutine F should not alter y(1),...,y(NEQ).
    ///          F must be declared External in the calling program.
    ///
    ///          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
    ///          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
    ///          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
    ///          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
    ///
    ///          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
    ///          externally to DLSODES, an extra call to F should be made
    ///          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
    ///          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
    ///
    /// NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order
    ///          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
    ///          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
    ///          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
    ///          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
    ///          these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
    ///
    ///          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
    ///          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
    ///          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
    ///          (The DLSODES package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
    ///          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
    ///          to F and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array, locations
    ///          NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
    ///          it to F and/or JAC.  Subroutines F and/or JAC must include
    ///          NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
    ///
    /// Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
    ///          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
    ///          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
    ///          on the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
    ///          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
    ///          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
    ///          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
    ///
    ///          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to
    ///          F and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
    ///          Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
    ///          pass it to F and/or JAC.  (The DLSODES package accesses only
    ///          Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
    ///
    /// T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
    ///          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
    ///          on output, after each call, T is the value at which a
    ///          computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
    ///          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
    ///
    /// TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
    ///          Used only for input.
    ///
    ///          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
    ///          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
    ///          For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
    ///          in order to determine the direction of the integration
    ///          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
    ///          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
    ///          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
    ///
    ///          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
    ///          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
    ///          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.

    /// Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
    /// declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
    /// that their contents are preserved.
    ///
    /// If the solution of a given problem by DLSODES is to be interrupted
    /// and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
    /// or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,

    /// internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
    /// next DLSODES call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
    /// blocks, use Subroutine DSRCMS (see Part 2 above).
    ///
    ///-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    /// Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
    ///
    /// Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODES package which
    /// relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
    /// replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
    /// a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
    /// done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
    /// (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
    /// superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
    ///
    /// (a) DEWSET.
    /// The following subroutine is called just before each internal
    /// integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
    /// described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
    ///     Subroutine DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
    /// where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODES call sequence,
    /// YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
    /// EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
    ///
    /// If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
    /// (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
    /// in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
    /// routine (see below), and also used by DLSODES in the computation
    /// of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
    /// and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
    ///
    /// In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
    /// the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
    /// are available from the history array YH, described above under
    /// optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
    /// extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
    /// factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
    /// given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
    /// NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
    /// can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
    ///     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
    ///     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
    ///     NQ = ILS(33)
    ///     NST = ILS(34)
    ///     H = RLS(212)
    /// Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
    /// YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
    /// unnecessary when NST = 0).
    ///
    /// (b) DVNORM.
    /// The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
    /// root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
    ///     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
    /// where
    ///   N = the length of the vector,
    ///   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
    ///   W = real array of length N containing weights,
    ///   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
    /// DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
    /// EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
    ///
    /// If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
    /// value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODES.
    /// None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
    /// For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
    ///   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
    ///   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
    ///    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

    ///  Summary of Usage.
    ///
    ///  Communication between the user and the DLSODI package, for normal
    ///  situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
    ///  of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
    ///  details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
    ///  and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
    ///  problem (with program and output) following this summary.
    ///
    ///  A. First, provide a subroutine of the form:
    ///                SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
    ///                DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
    ///  which computes the residual function
    ///      r = g(t,y)  -  A(t,y) * s ,
    ///  as a function of t and the vectors y and s.  (s is an internally
    ///  generated approximation to dy/dt.)  The arrays Y and S are inputs
    ///  to the RES routine and should not be altered.  The residual
    ///  vector is to be stored in the array R.  The argument IRES should be
    ///  ignored for casual use of DLSODI.  (For uses of IRES, see the
    ///  paragraph on RES in the full description below.)
    ///
    ///  B. Next, decide whether full or banded form is more economical
    ///  for the storage of matrices.  DLSODI must deal internally with the
    ///  matrices A and dr/dy, where r is the residual function defined above.
    ///  DLSODI generates a linear combination of these two matrices, and
    ///  this is treated in either full or banded form.
    ///      The matrix structure is communicated by a method flag MF,
    ///  which is 21 or 22 for the full case, and 24 or 25 in the band case.
    ///      In the banded case, DLSODI requires two half-bandwidth
    ///  parameters ML and MU.  These are, respectively, the widths of the
    ///  lower and upper parts of the band, excluding the main diagonal.
    ///  Thus the band consists of the locations (i,j) with
    ///  i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU, and the full bandwidth is ML+MU+1.
    ///  Note that the band must accommodate the nonzero elements of
    ///  A(t,y), dg/dy, and d(A*s)/dy (s fixed).  Alternatively, one
    ///  can define a band that encloses only the elements that are relatively
    ///  large in magnitude, and gain some economy in storage and possibly
    ///  also efficiency, although the appropriate threshhold for
    ///  retaining matrix elements is highly problem-dependent.
    ///
    ///  C. You must also provide a subroutine of the form:
    ///                SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, P, NROWP)
    ///                DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), P(NROWP,*)
    ///  which adds the matrix A = A(t,y) to the contents of the array P.
    ///  T and the Y array are input and should not be altered.
    ///      In the full matrix case, this routine should add elements of
    ///  to P in the usual order.  I.e., add A(i,j) to P(i,j).  (Ignore the
    ///  ML and MU arguments in this case.)
    ///      In the band matrix case, this routine should add element A(i,j)
    ///  to P(i-j+MU+1,j).  I.e., add the diagonal lines of A to the rows of
    ///  P from the top down (the top line of A added to the first row of P).
    ///
    ///  D. For the sake of efficiency, you are encouraged to supply the
    ///  Jacobian matrix dr/dy in closed form, where r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*s
    ///  (s = a fixed vector) as above.  If dr/dy is being supplied,
    ///  use MF = 21 or 24, and provide a subroutine of the form:
    ///                SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, ML, MU, P, NROWP)
    ///                DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), P(NROWP,*)
    ///  which computes dr/dy as a function of t, y, and s.  Here T, Y, and
    ///  S are inputs, and the routine is to load dr/dy into P as follows:
    ///      In the full matrix case (MF = 21), load P(i,j) with dr(i)/dy(j),
    ///  the partial derivative of r(i) with respect to y(j).  (Ignore the
    ///  ML and MU arguments in this case.)
    ///      In the band matrix case (MF = 24), load P(i-j+mu+1,j) with
    ///  dr(i)/dy(j), i.e. load the diagonal lines of dr/dy into the rows of
    ///  P from the top down.
    ///      In either case, only nonzero elements need be loaded, and the
    ///  indexing of P is the same as in the ADDA routine.
    ///      Note that if A is independent of y (or this dependence
    ///  is weak enough to be ignored) then JAC is to compute dg/dy.
    ///      If it is not feasible to provide a JAC routine, use
    ///  MF = 22 or 25, and DLSODI will compute an approximate Jacobian
    ///  internally by difference quotients.
    ///
    ///  E. Next decide whether or not to provide the initial value of the
    ///  derivative vector dy/dt.  If the initial value of A(t,y) is
    ///  nonsingular (and not too ill-conditioned), you may let DLSODI compute
    ///  this vector (ISTATE = 0).  (DLSODI will solve the system A*s = g for
    ///  s, with initial values of A and g.)  If A(t,y) is initially
    ///  singular, then the system is a differential-algebraic system, and
    ///  you must make use of the particular form of the system to compute the
    ///  initial values of y and dy/dt.  In that case, use ISTATE = 1 and
    ///  load the initial value of dy/dt into the array YDOTI.
    ///  The input array YDOTI and the initial Y array must be consistent with
    ///  the equations A*dy/dt = g.  This implies that the initial residual
    ///  r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*YDOTI  must be approximately zero.
    ///
    ///  F. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODI once for
    ///  each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
    ///  for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
    ///  by DLSODI.  On the first call to DLSODI, supply arguments as follows:
    ///  RES    = name of user subroutine for residual function r.
    ///  ADDA   = name of user subroutine for computing and adding A(t,y).
    ///  JAC    = name of user subroutine for Jacobian matrix dr/dy
    ///           (MF = 21 or 24).  If not used, pass a dummy name.
    ///  Note: the names for the RES and ADDA routines and (if used) the
    ///         JAC routine must be declared External in the calling program.
    ///  NEQ    = number of scalar equations in the system.
    ///  Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
    ///  YDOTI  = array of length NEQ (containing initial dy/dt if ISTATE = 1).

    ///  ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
    ///  RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
    ///  ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
    ///           the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
    ///           to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
    ///              EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
    ///              EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
    ///           Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
    ///           either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
    ///           or the relative error is less than RTOL.
    ///           Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
    ///           use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
    ///           control.  Caution: Actual (global) errors may exceed these
    ///           local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
    ///  ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
    ///  ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1 if the
    ///           initial dy/dt is supplied, and 0 otherwise.
    ///  IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
    ///  RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
    ///              22 +  9*NEQ + NEQ**2           for MF = 21 or 22,
    ///              22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML + MU)*NEQ  for MF = 24 or 25.
    ///  LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
    ///  IWORK  = integer work array of length at least 20 + NEQ.

    ///  MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:

    ///  Example Problem.
    ///
    ///  The following is a simple example problem, with the coding
    ///  needed for its solution by DLSODI.  The problem is from chemical
    ///  kinetics, and consists of the following three equations:
    ///      dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
    ///      dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
    ///        0.   = y1 + y2 + y3 - 1.
    ///  on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions
    ///  y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.
    ///
    ///  The following coding solves this problem with DLSODI, using MF = 21
    ///  and printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10.  It uses
    ///  ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3 because
    ///  y2 has much smaller values.  dy/dt is supplied in YDOTI. We had
    ///  obtained the initial value of dy3/dt by differentiating the
    ///  third equation and evaluating the first two at t = 0.

    ///  3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
    ///       or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt

    ///  Part 3.  Common Blocks.
    ///
    ///  If DLSODI is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
    ///  must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
    ///    (1) the call sequence to DLSODI, and
    ///    (2) the internal Common block

    ///                       followed by 37 integer words),
    ///
    ///  If DLSODI is used on a system in which the contents of internal
    ///  Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
    ///  declare the above Common block in the calling program to insure
    ///  that their contents are preserved.
    ///
    ///  If the solution of a given problem by DLSODI is to be interrupted
    ///  and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
    ///  or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
    ///  following the return from the last DLSODI call prior to the
    ///  interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
    ///  internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
    ///  next DLSODI call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
    ///  blocks, use Subroutine DSRCOM (see Part 2 above).
    ///
    /// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ///  Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
    ///
    ///  Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODI package which
    ///  relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
    ///  replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
    ///  a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
    ///  done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
    ///  (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
    ///  superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
    ///
    ///  (a) DEWSET.
    ///  The following subroutine is called just before each internal
    ///  integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
    ///  described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
    ///      SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
    ///  where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODI call sequence,
    ///  YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
    ///  EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
    ///
    ///  If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
    ///  (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
    ///  in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
    ///  routine (see below), and also used by DLSODI in the computation
    ///  of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
    ///  and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
    ///
    ///  In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
    ///  the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
    ///  are available from the history array YH, described above under
    ///  optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
    ///  extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
    ///  factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
    ///  given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
    ///  NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
    ///  can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
    ///      DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
    ///      COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
    ///      NQ = ILS(33)
    ///      NST = ILS(34)
    ///      H = RLS(212)
    ///  Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
    ///  YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
    ///  unnecessary when NST = 0).
    ///
    ///  (b) DVNORM.
    ///  The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
    ///  root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
    ///      D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
    ///  where:
    ///    N = the length of the vector,
    ///    V = real array of length N containing the vector,
    ///    W = real array of length N containing weights,
    ///    D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
    ///  DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
    ///  EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
    ///
    ///  If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
    ///  value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODI.
    ///  None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
    ///  For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
    ///    -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
    ///    -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
    ///     suppressing the error control on those components of y.

    ///  Summary of Usage.
    ///
    ///  Communication between the user and the DLSOIBT package, for normal
    ///  situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
    ///  of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
    ///  details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
    ///  and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
    ///  problem (with program and output) following this summary.
    ///
    ///  A. First, provide a subroutine of the form:
    ///                SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
    ///                DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
    ///  which computes the residual function
    ///      r = g(t,y)  -  A(t,y) * s ,
    ///  as a function of t and the vectors y and s.  (s is an internally
    ///  generated approximation to dy/dt.)  The arrays Y and S are inputs
    ///  to the RES routine and should not be altered.  The residual
    ///  vector is to be stored in the array R.  The argument IRES should be
    ///  ignored for casual use of DLSOIBT.  (For uses of IRES, see the
    ///  paragraph on RES in the full description below.)
    ///
    ///  B. Next, identify the block structure of the matrices A = A(t,y) and
    ///  dr/dy.  DLSOIBT must deal internally with a linear combination, P, of
    ///  these two matrices.  The matrix P (hence both A and dr/dy) must have
    ///  a block-tridiagonal form with fixed structure parameters
    ///      MB = block size, MB .ge. 1, and
    ///      NB = number of blocks in each direction, NB .ge. 4,
    ///  with MB*NB = NEQ.  In each of the NB block-rows of the matrix P
    ///  (each consisting of MB consecutive rows), the nonzero elements are
    ///  to lie in three consecutive MB by MB blocks.  In block-rows
    ///  2 through NB - 1, these are centered about the main diagonal.
    ///  in block-rows 1 and NB, they are the diagonal blocks and the two
    ///  blocks adjacent to the diagonal block.  (Thus block positions (1,3)
    ///  and (NB,NB-2) can be nonzero.)
    ///  Alternatively, P (hence A and dr/dy) may be only approximately
    ///  equal to matrices with this form, and DLSOIBT should still succeed.
    ///  The block-tridiagonal matrix P is described by three arrays,
    ///  each of size MB by MB by NB:
    ///      PA = array of diagonal blocks,
    ///      PB = array of superdiagonal (and one subdiagonal) blocks, and
    ///      PC = array of subdiagonal (and one superdiagonal) blocks.
    ///  Specifically, the three MB by MB blocks in the k-th block-row of P
    ///  are stored in (reading across):
    ///      PC(*,*,k) = block to the left of the diagonal block,
    ///      PA(*,*,k) = diagonal block, and
    ///      PB(*,*,k) = block to the right of the diagonal block,
    ///  except for k = 1, where the three blocks (reading across) are
    ///      PA(*,*,1) (= diagonal block), PB(*,*,1), and PC(*,*,1),
    ///  and k = NB, where they are
    ///      PB(*,*,NB), PC(*,*,NB), and PA(*,*,NB) (= diagonal block).
    ///  (Each asterisk * stands for an index that ranges from 1 to MB.)
    ///
    ///  C. You must also provide a subroutine of the form:
    ///      SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, MB, NB, PA, PB, PC)
    ///      DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PA(MB,MB,NB), PB(MB,MB,NB), PC(MB,MB,NB)
    ///  which adds the nonzero blocks of the matrix A = A(t,y) to the
    ///  contents of the arrays PA, PB, and PC, following the structure
    ///  description in Paragraph B above.
    ///  T and the Y array are input and should not be altered.
    ///  Thus the affect of ADDA should be the following:
    ///      DO 30 K = 1,NB
    ///        DO 20 J = 1,MB
    ///          DO 10 I = 1,MB
    ///            PA(I,J,K) = PA(I,J,K) +
    ///              ( (I,J) element of K-th diagonal block of A)
    ///            PB(I,J,K) = PB(I,J,K) +
    ///              ( (I,J) element of block in block position (K,K+1) of A,
    ///              or in block position (NB,NB-2) if K = NB)
    ///            PC(I,J,K) = PC(I,J,K) +
    ///              ( (I,J) element of block in block position (K,K-1) of A,
    ///              or in block position (1,3) if K = 1)
    ///  10        CONTINUE
    ///  20      CONTINUE
    ///  30    CONTINUE
    ///
    ///  D. For the sake of efficiency, you are encouraged to supply the
    ///  Jacobian matrix dr/dy in closed form, where r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*s
    ///  (s = a fixed vector) as above.  If dr/dy is being supplied,
    ///  use MF = 21, and provide a subroutine of the form:
    ///      SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, MB, NB, PA, PB, PC)
    ///      DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), PA(MB,MB,NB), PB(MB,MB,NB),
    ///     1                 PC(MB,MB,NB)
    ///  which computes dr/dy as a function of t, y, and s.  Here T, Y, and
    ///  S are inputs, and the routine is to load dr/dy into PA, PB, PC,
    ///  according to the structure description in Paragraph B above.
    ///  That is, load the diagonal blocks into PA, the superdiagonal blocks
    ///  (and block (NB,NB-2) ) into PB, and the subdiagonal blocks (and
    ///  block (1,3) ) into PC.  The blocks in block-row k of dr/dy are to
    ///  be loaded into PA(*,*,k), PB(*,*,k), and PC(*,*,k).
    ///      Only nonzero elements need be loaded, and the indexing
    ///  of PA, PB, and PC is the same as in the ADDA routine.
    ///      Note that if A is independent of Y (or this dependence
    ///  is weak enough to be ignored) then JAC is to compute dg/dy.
    ///      If it is not feasible to provide a JAC routine, use
    ///  MF = 22, and DLSOIBT will compute an approximate Jacobian
    ///  internally by difference quotients.
    ///
    ///  E. Next decide whether or not to provide the initial value of the
    ///  derivative vector dy/dt.  If the initial value of A(t,y) is
    ///  nonsingular (and not too ill-conditioned), you may let DLSOIBT compute
    ///  this vector (ISTATE = 0).  (DLSOIBT will solve the system A*s = g for
    ///  s, with initial values of A and g.)  If A(t,y) is initially
    ///  singular, then the system is a differential-algebraic system, and
    ///  you must make use of the particular form of the system to compute the
    ///  initial values of y and dy/dt.  In that case, use ISTATE = 1 and
    ///  load the initial value of dy/dt into the array YDOTI.
    ///  The input array YDOTI and the initial Y array must be consistent with
    ///  the equations A*dy/dt = g.  This implies that the initial residual
    ///  r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*YDOTI  must be approximately zero.
    ///
    ///  F. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSOIBT once for
    ///  each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
    ///  for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
    ///  DLSOIBT.  on the first call to DLSOIBT, supply arguments as follows:
    ///  RES    = name of user subroutine for residual function r.
    ///  ADDA   = name of user subroutine for computing and adding A(t,y).
    ///  JAC    = name of user subroutine for Jacobian matrix dr/dy
    ///           (MF = 21).  If not used, pass a dummy name.
    ///  Note: the names for the RES and ADDA routines and (if used) the
    ///         JAC routine must be declared External in the calling program.
    ///  NEQ    = number of scalar equations in the system.
    ///  Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
    ///  YDOTI  = array of length NEQ (containing initial dy/dt if ISTATE = 1).
    ///  T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
    ///  TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
    ///  ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
    ///  RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
    ///  ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
    ///           the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
    ///           to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
    ///              EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
    ///              EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
    ///           Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,

    ///  Example Problem.
    ///
    ///  The following is an example problem, with the coding needed
    ///  for its solution by DLSOIBT.  The problem comes from the partial
    ///  differential equation (the Burgers equation)
    ///    du/dt  =  - u * du/dx  +  eta * d**2 u/dx**2,   eta = .05,
    ///  on -1 .le. x .le. 1.  The boundary conditions are
    ///    du/dx = 0  at x = -1 and at x = 1.
    ///  The initial profile is a square wave,
    ///    u = 1 in ABS(x) .lt. .5,  u = .5 at ABS(x) = .5,  u = 0 elsewhere.
    ///  The PDE is discretized in x by a simplified Galerkin method,
    ///  using piecewise linear basis functions, on a grid of 40 intervals.
    ///  The equations at x = -1 and 1 use a 3-point difference approximation
    ///  for the right-hand side.  The result is a system A * dy/dt = g(y),
    ///  of size NEQ = 41, where y(i) is the approximation to u at x = x(i),
    ///  with x(i) = -1 + (i-1)*delx, delx = 2/(NEQ-1) = .05.  The individual
    ///  equations in the system are
    ///    dy(1)/dt = ( y(3) - 2*y(2) + y(1) ) * eta / delx**2,
    ///    dy(NEQ)/dt = ( y(NEQ-2) - 2*y(NEQ-1) + y(NEQ) ) * eta / delx**2,
    ///  and for i = 2, 3, ..., NEQ-1,

    ///          + ( y(i+1) - 2*y(i) + y(i-1) ) * eta / delx**2.
    ///  The following coding solves the problem with MF = 21, with output

    ///
    ///  The user interface to DLSOIBT consists of the following parts.
    ///
    ///  1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSOIBT, which is a driver
    ///       routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
    ///       the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
    ///       Following these descriptions is a description of
    ///       optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
    ///       a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
    ///
    ///  2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSOIBT package that may be
    ///       (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
    ///       alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
    ///       Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
    ///
    ///  3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
    ///       or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
    ///       of the problem and continued solution later.
    ///
    ///  4.   Description of two routines in the DLSOIBT package, either of
    ///       which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
    ///       These relate to the measurement of errors.
    ///
    /// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ///  Part 1.  Call Sequence.
    ///
    ///  The call sequence parameters used for input only are
    ///      RES, ADDA, JAC, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK,
    ///      IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
    ///  and those used for both input and output are
    ///      Y, T, ISTATE, YDOTI.
    ///  The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for additional and
    ///  optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
    ///  to the return from Subroutine DLSOIBT to the user's calling program.)
    ///
    ///  The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
    ///  initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
    ///  change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
    ///
    ///  The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
    ///
    ///  RES    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
    ///           the residual vector for the ODE system, defined by
    ///             r = g(t,y) - A(t,y) * s
    ///           as a function of the scalar t and the vectors
    ///           s and y (s approximates dy/dt).  This subroutine
    ///           is to have the form
    ///               SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
    ///               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
    ///           where NEQ, T, Y, S, and IRES are input, and R and
    ///           IRES are output. Y, S, and R are arrays of length NEQ.
    ///              On input, IRES indicates how DLSOIBT will use the
    ///           returned array R, as follows:
    ///              IRES = 1  means that DLSOIBT needs the full residual,
    ///                        r = g - A*s, exactly.
    ///              IRES = -1 means that DLSOIBT is using R only to compute
    ///                        the Jacobian dr/dy by difference quotients.
    ///           The RES routine can ignore IRES, or it can omit some terms
    ///           if IRES = -1.  If A does not depend on y, then RES can
    ///           just return R = g when IRES = -1.  If g - A*s contains other
    ///           additive terms that are independent of y, these can also be
    ///           dropped, if done consistently, when IRES = -1.
    ///              The subroutine should set the flag IRES if it
    ///           encounters a halt condition or illegal input.
    ///           Otherwise, it should not reset IRES.  On output,
    ///              IRES = 1 or -1 represents a normal return, and
    ///           DLSOIBT continues integrating the ODE.  Leave IRES
    ///           unchanged from its input value.
    ///              IRES = 2 tells DLSOIBT to immediately return control
    ///           to the calling program, with ISTATE = 3.  This lets
    ///           the calling program change parameters of the problem
    ///           if necessary.
    ///              IRES = 3 represents an error condition (for example, an
    ///           illegal value of y).  DLSOIBT tries to integrate the system
    ///           without getting IRES = 3 from RES.  If it cannot, DLSOIBT
    ///           returns with ISTATE = -7 or -1.
    ///              On an DLSOIBT return with ISTATE = 3, -1, or -7, the
    ///           values of T and Y returned correspond to the last point

    ///  Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
    ///
    ///  Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSOIBT package which
    ///  relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
    ///  replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
    ///  a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
    ///  done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
    ///  (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
    ///  superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
    ///
    ///  (a) DEWSET.
    ///  The following subroutine is called just before each internal
    ///  integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
    ///  described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
    ///      SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
    ///  where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSOIBT call sequence,
    ///  YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
    ///  EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
    ///
    ///  If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
    ///  (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
    ///  in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
    ///  routine (see below), and also used by DLSOIBT in the computation
    ///  of the optional output IMXER, the diagonal Jacobian approximation,
    ///  and the increments for difference quotient Jacobians.
    ///
    ///  In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
    ///  the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
    ///  are available from the history array YH, described above under
    ///  optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
    ///  extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
    ///  factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
    ///  given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
    ///  NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
    ///  can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
    ///      DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
    ///      COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
    ///      NQ = ILS(33)
    ///      NST = ILS(34)
    ///      H = RLS(212)
    ///  Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
    ///  YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
    ///  unnecessary when NST = 0).
    ///
    ///  (b) DVNORM.
    ///  The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
    ///  root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
    ///      D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
    ///  where:
    ///    N = the length of the vector,
    ///    V = real array of length N containing the vector,
    ///    W = real array of length N containing weights,
    ///    D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
    ///  DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
    ///  EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
    ///
    ///  If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
    ///  value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSOIBT.
    ///  None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
    ///  For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
    ///    -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*W(i)) for the RMS-norm, or
    ///    -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
    ///     suppressing the error control on those components of y.

    ///  Summary of Usage.
    ///
    ///  Communication between the user and the DLSODIS package, for normal
    ///  situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
    ///  of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
    ///  details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
    ///  and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
    ///  problem (with program and output) following this summary.
    ///
    ///  A. First, provide a subroutine of the form:
    ///                 SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
    ///                 DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
    ///  which computes the residual function
    ///       r = g(t,y)  -  A(t,y) * s ,
    ///  as a function of t and the vectors y and s.  (s is an internally
    ///  generated approximation to dy/dt.)  The arrays Y and S are inputs
    ///  to the RES routine and should not be altered.  The residual
    ///  vector is to be stored in the array R.  The argument IRES should be
    ///  ignored for casual use of DLSODIS.  (For uses of IRES, see the
    ///  paragraph on RES in the full description below.)
    ///
    ///  B. DLSODIS must deal internally with the matrices A and dr/dy, where
    ///  r is the residual function defined above.  DLSODIS generates a linear
    ///  combination of these two matrices in sparse form.
    ///       The matrix structure is communicated by a method flag, MF:
    ///          MF =  21 or  22     when the user provides the structures of
    ///                              matrix A and dr/dy,
    ///          MF = 121 or 222     when the user does not provide structure
    ///                              information, and
    ///          MF = 321 or 422     when the user provides the structure
    ///                              of matrix A.
    ///
    ///  C. You must also provide a subroutine of the form:
    ///                 SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, P)
    ///                 DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), P(*)
    ///                 INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
    ///  which adds the matrix A = A(t,y) to the contents of the array P.
    ///  NEQ, T, Y, and J are input arguments and should not be altered.
    ///  This routine should add the J-th column of matrix A to the array
    ///  P (of length NEQ).  I.e. add A(i,J) to P(i) for all relevant
    ///  values of i.  The arguments IAN and JAN should be ignored for normal
    ///  situations.  DLSODIS will call the ADDA routine with J = 1,2,...,NEQ.
    ///
    ///  D. For the sake of efficiency, you are encouraged to supply the
    ///  Jacobian matrix dr/dy in closed form, where r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*s
    ///  (s = a fixed vector) as above.  If dr/dy is being supplied,
    ///  use MF = 21, 121, or 321, and provide a subroutine of the form:
    ///                SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, J, IAN, JAN, PDJ)
    ///                DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), PDJ(*)
    ///                INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
    ///  which computes dr/dy as a function of t, y, and s.  Here NEQ, T, Y, S,
    ///  and J are input arguments, and the JAC routine is to load the array
    ///  PDJ (of length NEQ) with the J-th column of dr/dy.  I.e. load PDJ(i)
    ///  with dr(i)/dy(J) for all relevant values of i.  The arguments IAN and
    ///  JAN should be ignored for normal situations.  DLSODIS will call the
    ///  JAC routine with J = 1,2,...,NEQ.
    ///       Only nonzero elements need be loaded.  A crude approximation
    ///  to dr/dy, possibly with fewer nonzero elememts, will suffice.
    ///  Note that if A is independent of y (or this dependence
    ///  is weak enough to be ignored) then JAC is to compute dg/dy.
    ///       If it is not feasible to provide a JAC routine, use
    ///  MF = 22, 222, or 422 and DLSODIS will compute an approximate
    ///  Jacobian internally by difference quotients.
    ///
    ///  E. Next decide whether or not to provide the initial value of the
    ///  derivative vector dy/dt.  If the initial value of A(t,y) is
    ///  nonsingular (and not too ill-conditioned), you may let DLSODIS compute
    ///  this vector (ISTATE = 0).  (DLSODIS will solve the system A*s = g for
    ///  s, with initial values of A and g.)  If A(t,y) is initially
    ///  singular, then the system is a differential-algebraic system, and
    ///  you must make use of the particular form of the system to compute the
    ///  initial values of y and dy/dt.  In that case, use ISTATE = 1 and
    ///  load the initial value of dy/dt into the array YDOTI.
    ///  The input array YDOTI and the initial Y array must be consistent with
    ///  the equations A*dy/dt = g.  This implies that the initial residual
    ///  r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*YDOTI   must be approximately zero.
    ///
    ///  F. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODIS once for
    ///  each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
    ///  for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
    ///  DLSODIS.  On the first call to DLSODIS, supply arguments as follows:
    ///  RES    = name of user subroutine for residual function r.
    ///  ADDA   = name of user subroutine for computing and adding A(t,y).
    ///  JAC    = name of user subroutine for Jacobian matrix dr/dy
    ///           (MF = 121).  If not used, pass a dummy name.
    ///  Note: The names for the RES and ADDA routines and (if used) the
    ///         JAC routine must be declared External in the calling program.
    ///  NEQ    = number of scalar equations in the system.
    ///  Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
    ///  YDOTI  = array of length NEQ (containing initial dy/dt if ISTATE = 1).
    ///  T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
    ///  TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
    ///  ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
    ///  RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
    ///  ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
    ///           The estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
    ///           to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
    ///              EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
    ///              EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
    ///           Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
    ///           either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
    ///           or the relative error is less than RTOL.
    ///           Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
    ///           use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
    ///           control.  Caution: Actual (global) errors may exceed these
    ///           local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
    ///  ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
    ///  ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1 if the
    ///           initial dy/dt is supplied, and 0 otherwise.

    ///  RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
    ///              20 + (2 + 1./LENRAT)*NNZ + (11 + 9./LENRAT)*NEQ
    ///           where:
    ///           NNZ    = the number of nonzero elements in the sparse
    ///                    iteration matrix  P = A - con*dr/dy (con = scalar)
    ///                    (If NNZ is unknown, use an estimate of it.)
    ///           LENRAT = the real to integer wordlength ratio (usually 1 in
    ///                    single precision and 2 in double precision).
    ///           In any case, the required size of RWORK cannot generally
    ///           be predicted in advance for any value of MF, and the
    ///           value above is a rough estimate of a crude lower bound.
    ///           Some experimentation with this size may be necessary.
    ///           (When known, the correct required length is an optional
    ///           output, available in IWORK(17).)
    ///  LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
    ///  IWORK  = integer work array of length at least 30.

    ///           For other choices of MF, see the paragraph on MF in

    ///  Example Problem.
    ///

    ///  for its solution by DLSODIS.  The problem comes from the partial
    ///  differential equation (the Burgers equation)
    ///    du/dt  =  - u * du/dx  +  eta * d**2 u/dx**2,   eta = .05,
    ///  on -1 .le. x .le. 1.  The boundary conditions are periodic:
    ///    u(-1,t) = u(1,t)  and  du/dx(-1,t) = du/dx(1,t)
    ///  The initial profile is a square wave,
    ///    u = 1 in ABS(x) .lt. .5,  u = .5 at ABS(x) = .5,  u = 0 elsewhere.
    ///  The PDE is discretized in x by a simplified Galerkin method,
    ///  using piecewise linear basis functions, on a grid of 40 intervals.
    ///  The result is a system A * dy/dt = g(y), of size NEQ = 40,
    ///  where y(i) is the approximation to u at x = x(i), with
    ///  x(i) = -1 + (i-1)*delx, delx = 2/NEQ = .05.

    ///  Full Description of User Interface to DLSODIS.
    ///
    ///  The user interface to DLSODIS consists of the following parts.
    ///
    ///  1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODIS, which is a driver
    ///       routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
    ///       the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
    ///       Following these descriptions is a description of
    ///       optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
    ///       a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
    ///
    ///  2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODIS package that may be
    ///       (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
    ///       alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
    ///       Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
    ///
    ///  3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
    ///       or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
    ///       of the problem and continued solution later.
    ///
    ///  4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODIS package, either of
    ///       which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
    ///       These relate to the measurement of errors.
    ///
    /// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ///  Part 1.  Call Sequence.
    ///
    ///  The call sequence parameters used for input only are
    ///      RES, ADDA, JAC, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK,
    ///      IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
    ///  and those used for both input and output are
    ///      Y, T, ISTATE, YDOTI.
    ///  The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
    ///  optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
    ///  to the return from Subroutine DLSODIS to the user's calling program.)
    ///
    ///  The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
    ///  initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
    ///  change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
    ///
    ///  The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
    ///
    ///  RES    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
    ///           the residual vector for the ODE system, defined by
    ///             r = g(t,y) - A(t,y) * s
    ///           as a function of the scalar t and the vectors
    ///           s and y (s approximates dy/dt).  This subroutine
    ///           is to have the form
    ///                SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
    ///                DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
    ///           where NEQ, T, Y, S, and IRES are input, and R and
    ///           IRES are output.  Y, S, and R are arrays of length NEQ.
    ///              On input, IRES indicates how DLSODIS will use the
    ///           returned array R, as follows:
    ///              IRES = 1  means that DLSODIS needs the full residual,
    ///                        r = g - A*s, exactly.
    ///              IRES = -1 means that DLSODIS is using R only to compute
    ///                        the Jacobian dr/dy by difference quotients.
    ///           The RES routine can ignore IRES, or it can omit some terms
    ///           if IRES = -1.  If A does not depend on y, then RES can
    ///           just return R = g when IRES = -1.  If g - A*s contains other
    ///           additive terms that are independent of y, these can also be
    ///           dropped, if done consistently, when IRES = -1.
    ///              The subroutine should set the flag IRES if it
    ///           encounters a halt condition or illegal input.
    ///           Otherwise, it should not reset IRES.  On output,
    ///              IRES = 1 or -1 represents a normal return, and
    ///           DLSODIS continues integrating the ODE.  Leave IRES
    ///           unchanged from its input value.
    ///              IRES = 2 tells DLSODIS to immediately return control
    ///           to the calling program, with ISTATE = 3.  This lets
    ///           the calling program change parameters of the problem
    ///           if necessary.
    ///              IRES = 3 represents an error condition (for example, an
    ///           illegal value of y).  DLSODIS tries to integrate the system
    ///           without getting IRES = 3 from RES.  If it cannot, DLSODIS
    ///           returns with ISTATE = -7 or -1.
    ///              On a return with ISTATE = 3, -1, or -7, the values
    ///           of T and Y returned correspond to the last point reached
    ///           successfully without getting the flag IRES = 2 or 3.
    ///              The flag values IRES = 2 and 3 should not be used to
    ///           handle switches or root-stop conditions.  This is better
    ///           done by calling DLSODIS in a one-step mode and checking the
    ///           stopping function for a sign change at each step.
    ///              If quantities computed in the RES routine are needed
    ///           externally to DLSODIS, an extra call to RES should be made

    ///  Part 3.  Common Blocks.
    ///
    ///  If DLSODIS is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
    ///  must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
    ///    (1) the call sequence to DLSODIS, and
    ///    (2) the two internal Common blocks
    ///          /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
    ///                       followed by 37 integer words),
    ///          /DLSS01/  of length  40  (6 double precision words
    ///                       followed by 34 integer words).
    ///
    ///  If DLSODIS is used on a system in which the contents of internal
    ///  Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
    ///  declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
    ///  that their contents are preserved.
    ///
    ///  If the solution of a given problem by DLSODIS is to be interrupted
    ///  and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
    ///  or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
    ///  following the return from the last DLSODIS call prior to the
    ///  interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
    ///  internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
    ///  next DLSODIS call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
    ///  blocks, use Subroutines DSRCMS (see Part 2 above).
    ///
    /// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ///  Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
    ///
    ///  Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODIS package which
    ///  relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
    ///  replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
    ///  a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
    ///  done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
    ///  (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
    ///  superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
    ///
    ///  (a) DEWSET.
    ///  The following subroutine is called just before each internal
    ///  integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
    ///  described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
    ///      SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
    ///  where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODIS call sequence,
    ///  YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
    ///  EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
    ///
    ///  If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
    ///  (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
    ///  in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
    ///  routine (see below), and also used by DLSODIS in the computation
    ///  of the optional output IMXER, and the increments for difference
    ///  quotient Jacobians.
    ///
    ///  In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
    ///  the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
    ///  are available from the history array YH, described above under
    ///  optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
    ///  extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
    ///  factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
    ///  given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
    ///  NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
    ///  can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
    ///      DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
    ///      COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
    ///      NQ = ILS(33)
    ///      NST = ILS(34)
    ///      H = RLS(212)
    ///  Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
    ///  YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
    ///  unnecessary when NST = 0).
    ///
    ///  (b) DVNORM.
    ///  The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
    ///  root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
    ///      D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
    ///  where:
    ///    N = the length of the vector,
    ///    V = real array of length N containing the vector,
    ///    W = real array of length N containing weights,
    ///    D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
    ///  DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
    ///  EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.
    ///
    ///  If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
    ///  value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODIS.
    ///  None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
    ///  For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
    ///    -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*w(I)) for the RMS-norm, or
    ///    -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
    ///     suppressing the error control on those components of y.
