# Solve systems of differential equations

This crate uses ODEPACK Fortran library to solve systems of ordinary differential equations and differential algebraic equations.

# ODEPACK

I obtained the [ODEPACK][1] code that is present in this repository from [here](http://www.netlib.org/odepack/).
I do not know what the licensing of the original ODEPACK code is, I assume it is released to the public domain.
